# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# 100.times do 
#   contact = Contact.new(first_name: "ever", last_name: "greatest", email: "great@gmail.com", phone_number: "45678765")
#   contact.save
# end




  contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Anton", last_name: "Lavey", email: "antonlavey@gmail.com", phone_number: "312-666-0666")
